## Development Environment

If you need a vagrant box for development, we recommend using [adlawson/vagrantfiles](https://github.com/adlawson/vagrantfiles), for PHP:

```shell
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adlawson/vagrantfiles/master/php/Vagrantfile
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /srv
```

## Running Tests

You can run all of the test suites in the project using:

```shell
$ make test
```

Or run individual suites using:

```shell
$ make test-unit
$ make test-functional
```

You can get a coverage report in text and HTML by running:

```shell
$ make test-coverage
$ make test-unit-coverage
$ make test-functional-coverage
```
