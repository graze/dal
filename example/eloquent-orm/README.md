# EloquentORM DAL Adapter

This example shows a concrete implementation of the [ActiveRecord Adapter][ar]
using Laravel's [Eloquent ORM][eloquent].

It isn't in the main source of the library because it isn't something we'll be
using ourselves so it will likely become broken and outdated. If there is enough
support to move it back into the main source we would certainly consider it.
